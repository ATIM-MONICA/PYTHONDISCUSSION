# Question 2(i)

# Define a function named calculate_bmi that takes a person's weight (in kilograms) and height (in 
# meters) as parameters and returns their BMI. (BMI = weight/height) 
# Calculate and sen their BMI category: 
# Below 18.5: "Underweight" 
# 18.5 to 24.9: "Normal weight" 
# 25 to 29.9: "Overweight" 
# 30 or above: "Obese" 
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)  
    if bmi < 18.5:
        category = "Underweight"
    elif 18.5 <= bmi <= 24.9:
        category = "Normal weight"
    elif 25 <= bmi <= 29.9:
        category = "Overweight"
    else:
        category = "Obese"
    return round(bmi, 2), category

weight = float(input("Enter the weight: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height: "))
bmi, category = calculate_bmi(weight, height)

print(f"BMI: {bmi}, Category: {category}")
